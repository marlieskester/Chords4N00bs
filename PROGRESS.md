# day 1
Write proposal, chose subject guitar chords.
# day 2
Written design idea, started on API code
# day 3
First meeting, worked on application design.
Possible issues
- parsing for chords
- determine key
- insert diagrams
- autoscroll

basically everything starting at songactivity&chordactivity.
Aim: finish everything up to songactivity&chordactivity this week.
(maybe except songbook)

# day 4
Plan for today: get it working up to list-of-songs, get navigation working for entire app.
Done today: updating adroid studio after a lot of crashes. Not much code writing.

# day 5
Presenting code, finishing prototype, still struggling with API

API struggle = overcome!! Searching a song is possible and gives an (imperfect) listview.
Next goal:
- songactivity: match title to song
- playactivity: get chords&lyrics lined out properly
