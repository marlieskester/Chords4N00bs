# day 1
Write proposal, chose subject guitar chords.
# day 2
Written design idea, started on API code
# day 3
First meeting, worked on application design.
Possible issues
- parsing for chords
- determine key
- insert diagrams
- autoscroll

basically everything starting at songactivity&chordactivity.
Aim: finish everything up to songactivity&chordactivity this week.
(maybe except songbook)

# day 4
Plan for today: get it working up to list-of-songs, get navigation working for entire app.
Done today: updating adroid studio after a lot of crashes. Not much code writing.

# day 5
Presenting code, finishing prototype, still struggling with API

API struggle = overcome!! Searching a song is possible and gives an (imperfect) listview.
Next goal:
- songactivity: match title to song     V
- playactivity: get chords&lyrics lined out properly    V

# day 6 (week 2.1)
aim for today: get some content for playactivity        V
next goal: autoscroll
autsoscroll not finished yet, started on SQL (writing works, reading not yet)


MVP finished!
------------------
What's next?
- transpose
- autoscroll
- diagrams
- songbook
- chordsearch

# day 7 (2.2)
No trains today :(
But started early on SQL; reading and writing is fully functional.
Today: delete (update maybe in beta version), more work on auoscroll function.

Autoscroll will probably work best in listview -> today parse lyrics&chords to create a listview-supported display of the song


# days that I forgot to log
Finished parser, added functionality for diagram checkbox, tried to fix THE BUG (you can only search for some songs) but did not succeed just yet. Spent hours to find a way to implement autoscroll. What's finished: the entire SQL thing, searching up to displaying a song.

# day 3.1
Today: fix small songbook bug (caused by incorrect separation of concerns), fix autoscroll(?).
Other things that need to be done: THE BUG, API2, transpose (and of course layout etc)

Done: Songbook bug, THE BUG, some autoscrollwork

# day 3.2
Had to attend a meeting in the morning.

Did fix the chord-diagram-bug in the guitar API, so I can go on with that on my own. Also did some work on the transpose function, which requires a different parser.
