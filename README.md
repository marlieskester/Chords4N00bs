# Proposal
The problem 
------------------
1 guitar, campfire, cosy, all we need is somebody who can actually play the guitarâ€¦
The solution: 
------------------
An application with which you can search for songs which are then displayed using an autmatic scroll function. This wayevery song available in the database can be played by the user, handsfree. To make life more easy a transpose option (changing the itch of the song) will be available, so that you can either work around difficult chords or make the song easier to sing.
