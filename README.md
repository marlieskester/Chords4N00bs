# Summary
Create an Android Application which helps musicians by displaying songs and chords.
# Proposal
The problem 
------------------
1 guitar, campfire, cosy, all we need is somebody who can actually play the guitarâ€¦
The solution: 
------------------
An application with which you can search for songs which are then displayed using an autmatic scroll function. This wayevery song available in the database can be played by the user, handsfree. To make life more easy a transpose option (changing the itch of the song) will be available, so that you can either work around difficult chords or make the song easier to sing.  
Minimum: 
------------------
At the very least, the application should show the song and chords in a structured manner.
Ideal:
------------------
It would be best to have transpose function, chorddiagrams for guitar and ukulele (and the option to hide them), an automatic scroll feature and a personal songbook in which songs canbe saved. I might also add an extra search in which you can search for a chord, which then duisplayes an image of how you can play this chord. 
This requires:
------------------
- a chords+lyrics API. 
  I have found this and it works, only it doesn;'t work as good as I would want it to. It doesn't contain transpose options, the database is rather small and the search works in a quirky way. Unfortunately this is the only API available so I do have to use it. 
- a chord-diagram API
	This exists, both for guitar and ukulele, so that should be fine.

Limitations:
------------------
I have no experience in implementing automatic scoll, so that will be a challenge, and there are some API limitations.
